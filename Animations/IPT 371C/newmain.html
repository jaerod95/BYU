            <p>As a teacher you will very likely be organized into a professional learning community (PLC). &nbsp;A PLC is a group of teachers (usually in the same grade level in elementary or subject area in secondary) that collaborate together to improve
                student learning. &nbsp;They often share curriculum and even collaborate on creating and evaluating common assessments.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For the next several weeks as you complete Unit 2 of this course, you will have a&nbsp;group of peers who provide feedback to you on the online lesson that you are developing. We will call this group of peers your IPT371 Professional Learning
                Community. &nbsp;Each student in the course will be responsible for individually designing and creating an online lesson to submit. &nbsp;The PLC will fulfill the following roles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: transparent;">PLC members will review the online lesson design of peers in their group</span></li>
                <li>PLC members will complete assignments and assessments created by peers in their group (this will allow you to practice online grading and providing student feedback online).</li>
                <li>PLC members will provide suggestions for improving&nbsp;the design of the assessments and activities&nbsp;of peers in their group</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Follow these instructions to join&nbsp;a PLC group:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>click on the "People" link in the lefthand menu&nbsp;</li>
                <li>click on the Groups tab</li>
                <li>click the "JOIN" link for the PLC that you want to join (only four students can join any given group)&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">PLANNING YOUR ONLINE/BLENDED LESSON</span></strong></h3>
            <p>&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">During Unit 2&nbsp;you will plan and create an online lesson with online activities and assessments. You will compare strengths and limitations of your online lesson to a lesson plan for traditional classroom instruction. Go through the presentation&nbsp;below for a brief orientation about designing your online/blended learning lesson.&nbsp;</span></p>

            &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The image above&nbsp;shows a basic outline for the elements that should be in your final online/blended lesson. &nbsp;Use the <a id="" class=" instructure_scribd_file instructure_file_link" title="IPT 371B Online Lesson Planning Worksheet.docx" href="/courses/138/files/14097/download?wrap=1" target="" data-api-endpoint="https://byu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/138/files/14097" data-api-returntype="File">planning worksheet</a> to document and submit ideas for your online lesson.&nbsp;</span></div>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose a Learning Objective and Find a Traditional Lesson Plan</span></p>
        <p>Select a CORE curriculum objective from your teaching subject area to focus your lesson on (see <a href="http://www.uen.org/core/">http://www.uen.org/core/</a>). &nbsp;Your design task will be easier if you select a topic</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: transparent;">that you would&nbsp;currently be comfortable teaching</span></li>
            <li><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: transparent;">that you have or can find a traditional classroom-based lesson plan for&nbsp;</span></li>
            <li><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: transparent;">that lends itself to online activities</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: transparent;">As you start thinking about your lesson, you should consider a lesson that can be done within a couple of days to a week's time. &nbsp;Also, you will want to make sure that there is strong alignment between the outcomes, assessments, and activities that you choose. &nbsp;Watch this brief video about aligning activities with assessments.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Explore Quiz Questions for your Final Assessment</span></p>
        <p>The second step in your process is to explore questions for your final lesson assessment. &nbsp;You do not have to develop the full assessment at this time, but you should get some clear ideas about the the questions you might ask in the assessment
            because you will need to create assignments and activities that help student prepare for the final assessment.</p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Brainstorm Ideas for a Lesson Assignment</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;You will also need to brainstorm ideas for a graded assignment in the online/blended lesson. &nbsp;Make sure that your assignment ideas align back to the CORE objectives that you have identified.</p>


        <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">See Section 2 in <a id="" class="" title="" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DGZEOBr-0NPP5FpndHmYdr4ZjT7dqZFJN1QBuSIcO-g/edit?usp=sharing" target="">Elementary Ed worked example</a>.<br /></span>

        <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Brainstorm Ideas for a Content-driven Activity</span></p>
        <p>Activities that you develop do not need to be graded. &nbsp;However, it can be beneficial if students are able to get formative feedback on their performance in the activity. &nbsp;Go through the presentation below to get an idea of a range of
            different online learner-content activities you can consider.&nbsp;</p>
        <table>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Brainstorm Ideas for a Community-driven Activity</span></p>
        <span>In this step you will brainstorm several activities that involve students learning together online. &nbsp;Go through the presentation below to get an idea of a range of different online learner-learner activities you can consider.</span>&nbsp;</div>
    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>

    <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Step 6:</strong> Provide a Rationale for the&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;It is important for you to think about what value your online/blended activities and assessments add to the lesson. &nbsp;Share your lesson ideas with at least one member of your PLC and get feedback from him/her on your assignment and activity
        ideas. &nbsp;Pick one of your assessment ideas and one of your activity ideas to analyze within the planning worksheet using the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PIC</strong> - What is the student relationship to the technology (Passive, Interactive, Creative)?</li>
        <li><strong>RAT</strong> - How does the online lesson change the teacher&rsquo;s traditional practice (replace, amplify, transform)?</li>
        <li><strong>ACCESS</strong> &ndash; How does the online lesson affect student access to learning experiences when compared to the traditional lesson?</li>
        <li><strong>STUDENT LEARNING</strong> &ndash; How does the online lesson intend to impact student learning as compared to the traditional lesson? (i.e., What value does it add?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">See <a id="" class="" title="" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DGZEOBr-0NPP5FpndHmYdr4ZjT7dqZFJN1QBuSIcO-g/edit?usp=sharing" target="">Elementary Ed worked example</a>.<br /></span>
        <span style="font-size: 12pt;">See Secondary Ed worked example.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">NOTE: At this point your ideas need to be concrete but you can always adapt and change as you progress through the unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Build Online Module Structure in Canvas LMS</span></strong></h3>
    <p>Once you have completed the planning worksheet you will create the structure for your online lesson (or module) in Canvas. &nbsp;Think of this as your lesson shell - you are creating and organizing the pieces of the lesson, but the content of each
        of the pieces does not exist yet.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To complete this assignment do the following:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Create a Canvas Course for your module</strong> (<span>use the </span><span><span><a class="external" title="" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/community/answers/guides/" target="_blank">Canvas Guides</a>&nbsp;accessed from the Help menu if needed</span></span>)</p>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Name your course "&lt;first name last name&gt; - Canvas Module with your name in place of "<span>&lt;first name last name&gt;"</span></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Add all members of your PLC as "students" in the course and add "charles.graham@byu.edu" as a "<strong>Teacher</strong>"&nbsp;in your course</li>
            <li>Make sure your Canvas profile is updated with your name and photo</li>
            <li>Go to the Canvas settings on the left hand side and familiarize yourself with different options. &nbsp;Hide all of the navigation elements for your course except for&nbsp;Modules and Grades.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><span><strong>2. Create a Module for your Lesson in Canvas</strong> (</span><span>use the </span><span><span><a class="external" title="" href="https://community.canvaslms.com/community/answers/guides/" target="_blank">Canvas Guides</a>&nbsp;accessed from the Help menu if needed)</span></span>

    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Title your module appropriately related to the standard/learning objective you are addressing</li>
            <li>Add at least the following elements to your module structure</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A lesson intro and instructions (content page)</li>
                <li>Assessment: An assignment page (assignment page)&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Assessment: A quiz/exam (quiz page)</li>
                <li>A page for your content-driven activity (likely a content page)</li>
                <li>A page for your community-driven activity (likely a discussion page)</li>
                <li>Note: These elements in your structure are placeholders and don't have to contain the actual content of your assessments or activities yet.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li>You may explore/practice adding the following elements to your module structure</li>
            <ul>
                <li>File</li>
                <li>Text Header (Figure out how to use text headers and indenting to visually organize the elements in your module)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li>External URL</li>
                <li>Figure out how to use text headers and indenting to visually organize the elements in your module.</li>
                <li>Note: Make sure that you "publish" your module and the module elements by clicking on the gray cloud on the right hand side until it turns green with a checkmark in it.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
