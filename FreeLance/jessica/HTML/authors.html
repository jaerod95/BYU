<p class="blurb">I thought I'd be a librarian (reference, not cataloging) and earned an MLIS degree at Brigham Young University before they shut the Library School, but became a writer of software documentation instead (WordPerfect's Presentations, in particular). WordPerfect, the Cinderella of software, turned into a pumpkin shortly after I was hired, which eventually led me to a job writing training materials, then to BYU's Center for Instructional Design, and thence to Independent Study. My experience with writing speculative fiction (since the manual has to be complete before the code is) led me to try my hand at producing more interesting fantasy/SF novels (the "Seventh Seal" series, and the Cracker Hounds trilogy). I bring handwork (crocheting, embroidery) to long seminars, meetings, and other events to keep myself awake, so those may count as a hobby. I have no children, pets, or interesting superstitions, but I can remember a vast variety of odd little pieces of trivia when properly prompted.</p>

<p class="blurb">Jessica Draper and Richard D. Draper are a daughter/father writing team. Richard Draper recently retired from the Department of Ancient Scripture at Brigham Young University, where he taught New Testament and wrote on a variety of topics—including his specialties, the Book of Revelation and other aspects of the last days. He supplied the vision, enthusiasm, and scriptural knowledge that give this story (and the previous trilogy, Seventh Seal, Rising Storm, and Final Hour) its doctrinal foundation. Jessica Draper is still a long way from retirement, but she enjoys writing speculative fiction. She supplied the fictional elements of the plot—or, as she says it, the magic and mayhem.</p>
