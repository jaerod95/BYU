<h3><a class="amazonlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Jessica-Draper/e/B001K8A87Q" target="_blank">by Jessica Draper</a></h3>
<p>In a world where man-made Plagues wiped out half of  the human population, magic has made a comeback—with a vengeance. Magical  creatures flourish, and magical abilities that were once dormant or  non-existent in humans now manifest in the &quot;normal&quot; human population.</p>
<p class="blurb">With militant anti-Magic skinheads on one side and  street-fey gangs on the other, Joe, Kitayn, Star, Eifion, and the rest of the  law- enforcement officers of the Magical Ethics Enforcement Agency chase, dodge  and squirm (blasted pixies!) to protect the citizenry of the Northwest Region.  It turns out that defending against demons, street fey, angry firestarters, and  pixies might be the easy part of a job that earned them the nickname Magic  &amp; Mayhem Squad.</p>
<p class="blurb">The situation turns explosive when the Nightshade  de Wolf, head of the Magicians&rsquo; Council, confirms that a rogue Magician is  helping the Skinners. Meanwhile, Dr. Mark Albrecht is willing to use any  magical means necessary to make the Region into a magical Utopia, with or  without the cooperation of his fellow Magicians.</p>
<p class="blurb">The M&amp;M Squad is about to find out that the  most dangerous demons lurk inside . . .</p>

        <p class="blurb">And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison. And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle…. In the thousand years after the Second Coming, mankind lived in peace and righteousness for centuries. Deception, theft, and violence were all things of the distant past. Ancient history. Until a corpse that surfaces in the lake near the family cabin turns out to be a powerful government official whose body shows clear signs of premeditated murder—he was stabbed to death. With age comes wisdom and experience … and by virtue of those characteristics (and the fact that their grandson found the body), the Regional Authority calls former judge Juan Schumann-Martinez and his wife, Celeste Song-Martinez, away from their family gathering to solve the first murder in a millennium. But how? As they recreate the unthinkable crime and the insane motives behind it, Juan and Celeste face the chilling realization that the rumors that Satan has been set free for the last time are true, and that shadowy forces have positioned the pieces on the board for the very last battle of Good vs. Evil. This is a tale of the very last days. </p>
